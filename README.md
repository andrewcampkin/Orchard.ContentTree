# Orchard.ContentTree

I have extracted the archive from https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=orchardcontenttree and added it here so anyone can make use of this Orchard module more easily.
This module will add a content tree to your Orchard admin page, showing content items in a nested structure based on their route.  The tree also allows direct access to editing and publishing options.

This has been used with a project using Orchard 1.10.1.
